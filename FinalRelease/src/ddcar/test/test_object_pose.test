        This test file will run all five tests.
        It uses "world6.world" as the simulated world, you can change this in line 14.
        If you change the default simulated world, don't forget to change other expected parameters.
        You can set the expected barrier number in line 17.
        You can set the expected objects in line 19.
        If your simulated world file has different house models, such as house_1, house_2 and house_3, please set them all to be house_3 in "expected_objects", because this project can't distinguish different houses.
        Don't worry about the order you typed in "expected_objects", we will sort them for you.
